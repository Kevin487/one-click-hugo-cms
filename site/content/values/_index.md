      Art holds a lot of power, which is proven through its multifaceted uses
      throughout history. I believe staring, analyzing, and appreciating a work
      of art will awaken a feeling within a person. Therefore, it is important
      to be picky on the topics of art someone wants to buy. A piece of art can
      positively or negatively transform the atmosphere of a persons mind or
      home.

      Positivity is a mindset and a feeling that is controlled through self
      awareness and external variables. Understanding that positivity can
      contribute to mental health, physical health, and productivity rates can
      bring about new convictions of meaning, understanding, and self-love.

    text: >
      A healthy mind and body, while remaining positive can lead to a healthy
      view of life. Handling situations, including difficult ones, will have
      positive references, which will enhance calm and peace. Remaining calm and
      peaceful will complement self awareness and strengthen positive
      perception of world situations. A peaceful and calm mindset can also be
      found within meditation. Meditation can be done by taking in deep breaths,
      which will stimulate a sense of relief. Art can help stimulate this
      process through visual stimulation.
