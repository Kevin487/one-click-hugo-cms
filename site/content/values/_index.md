      The utility and meaning of art has many variations within our society.
      Art can be a very powerful tool for propaganda or conveying complex
      imagery and a lot more. Therefore, art is also an excellent tool in
      empowering and refocusing positive energies. The art featured here will
      be focused around sharing positivity, grace, and relief.

      Art holds a lot of power, which is proven through its multifaceted uses
      throughout history. I believe staring, analyzing, and appreciating a work
      of art will awaken a feeling within a person. Therefore, it is important
      to be picky on the topics of art someone wants to buy. A piece of art can
      positively or negatively transform the atmosphere of a persons mind or
      home.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on
      an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of
      relationships between organisms and their environment. What
      grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and
      careful consideration for nature and communities.
