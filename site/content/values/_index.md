      The utility and meaning of art has many variations within our society.
      Art can be a very powerful tool for propaganda or conveying complex
      imagery and a lot more. Therefore, art is also an excellent tool in
      empowering and refocusing positive energies. The art featured here will
      be focused around sharing positivity, grace, and relief.

      Art holds a lot of power, which is proven through its multifaceted uses
      throughout history. I believe staring, analyzing, and appreciating a work
      of art will awaken a feeling within a person. Therefore, it is important
      to be picky on the topics of art someone wants to buy. A piece of art can
      positively or negatively transform the atmosphere of a persons mind or
      home.

    text: >
      Positivity is a mindset and feeling that is controlled through self
      awareness and external variables. Understanding that positivity can
      contribute to mental health, physical health, and productivity rates can
      bring about new convictions of meaning, understanding, and self-love.
