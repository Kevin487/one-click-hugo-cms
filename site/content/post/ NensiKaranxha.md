[ICE SKATING IN FROG POND MATTED ART PRINT](http://www.boston-artwork.com/shop/ice-skating-in-frog-pond-matted-art-print) conveys the feeling of winter. Gaze upon this painting in your living room and reminisce of the days you spent with your family, at an ice skating rink, on a cold winters night that strangely felt warm.
