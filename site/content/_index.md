    heading: Our values
    text: Art is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too â€“ one of colonialism and mindless abuse of monopoly and ecomerce. We want to turn this around and return the art trade to the art's exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature. We love to create a hub of individual artists and give them the opportunity to create and sell their artwork.
